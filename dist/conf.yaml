# battctl conf file

# this files contains the battctl monitor configuration.
# you can change the delay, charging start and end for
# both mobile (AC unplugged) and docked (AC plugged) modes.
# the delay represents how long to wait before going into
# either mode. Start and end controls at which battery percentage
# the EC should start or stop the charging cycle.
#
# For example if start is 90 and end is 95, the laptop will start
# charging when battery level is < 90% and will stop charging when
# it reaches > 95%.

# how long to wait before switching to docked mode
# when AC is connected.
docked-delay: 24h

# value for the charge start threshold in docked mode.
docked-start: 40

# value for the charge end threshold in docked mode.
docked-end: 95

# how long to wait before switching to mobile mode
# when AC is disconnected.
mobile-delay: 30m

# value for the charge start threshold in monitor mode.
mobile-start: 90
